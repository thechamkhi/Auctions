# CS50 Web Programming Project - Commerce

Welcome to my third project for the CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.  
In this project, I have designed an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a "watchlist."

## Project Demonstration

I am pleased to present a comprehensive video demonstration highlighting the functionality and features of this project. This showcase provides an in-depth understanding of the project's capabilities and showcases it in action.

For those seeking a more hands-on experience, I invite you to explore the live version of the project by following this [link](https://thechamkhi3.pythonanywhere.com). This allows you to interact with the application directly, offering a firsthand experience. Your valuable feedback is highly appreciated.
